    Use the `providers` block to choose which provider instances appear in the
    dashboard and whether sections are grouped by provider by default.

    Provider instance IDs use the format `<provider>:<host>`, for example:

    - `github:github.com`
    - `github:github.mycorp.com`
    - `gitlab:gitlab.com`
    - `gitlab:gitlab.mycorp.com`
