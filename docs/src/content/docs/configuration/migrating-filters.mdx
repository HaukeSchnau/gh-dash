# Migrating Filters to the DSL

Filters now use the provider-agnostic DSL. Legacy GitHub search qualifiers
(`is:open`, `repo:org/repo`, `-author:@me`, etc.) are no longer accepted.

This guide helps you translate existing filters to the new syntax.

## Key changes

- Use `filters` (plural) and write valid DSL expressions.
- String values must be quoted.
- Use `and`, `or`, and `not` for boolean logic (GitLab only supports `and`).
- Use `in` / `not in` for list membership.
- Use `updated` / `created` with dates, durations, or `last(...)`.

## Common translations

```yaml
# GitHub search: is:open author:@me
filters: state = "open" and author = "me"
```

```yaml
# GitHub search: repo:org/repo
filters: project = "org/repo"
```

```yaml
# GitHub search: -author:@me
filters: author != "me"
```

```yaml
# GitHub search: label:bug label:critical
filters: label in ["bug", "critical"]
```

```yaml
# GitHub search: updated:>=2025-12-01
filters: updated >= 2025-12-01
```

```yaml
# GitHub search: updated:>=2025-12-01 updated:<=2025-12-31
filters: updated >= 2025-12-01 and updated <= 2025-12-31
```

```yaml
# GitHub search: updated:>=2025-12-01 (relative)
filters: updated in last(7d)
```

```yaml
# GitHub search: review-requested:@me
filters: review_requested = "me"
```

```yaml
# GitHub search: draft:true
filters: draft = true
```

```yaml
# GitHub search: words in the title/body
filters: text = "dependency upgrade"
```

## Provider scoping

You can scope a section to specific providers:

```yaml
filters: provider in ["github", "gitlab:gitlab.mycorp.com"] and state = "open"
```

## Notes

- `me` is normalized to `@me` automatically, so `author = "me"` and
  `author = "@me"` are equivalent.
- Provider filters must be combined with `and`, and cannot be negated.
- If a predicate is unsupported by a provider instance, that provider shows a
  scoped error while other providers continue to load.
