  How to search and filter issues and prs with the DSL
weight: 3
---

# Searching

Searching for prs and issues is done by defining sections and their filters.
Search filters are defined using the provider-agnostic DSL.

For example, this section shows open PRs authored by anyone but me, which were
updated in the last 2 weeks.

```yaml
prsSections:
  - title: Review
    filters: >-
      state = "open"
      author != "me"
      updated in last(2w)
```

Note: don't specify `type = "pr"` for this setting. The dashboard always adds that
filter for PR sections.

You can define any combination of filters. To make it easier to read and maintain
your filters, we recommend using the `>-` syntax after the `filters` key and writing
one filter per line.

For a migration guide and examples, see [Migrating Filters to the DSL].

## DSL Essentials

- Strings must be quoted: `author = "me"`.
- Lists are bracketed: `label in ["bug", "urgent"]`.
- Boolean operators: `and`, `or`, `not` (GitLab supports only `and`).
- Dates and durations:
  - `updated >= 2025-12-01`
  - `updated in last(7d)`
  - `updated >= -14d`

## Provider Scoping

You can scope a section to specific providers with the `provider` predicate:

```yaml
filters: provider in ["github", "gitlab:gitlab.mycorp.com"] and state = "open"
```

## Provider Limitations

If a predicate or operator is unsupported by a provider instance, that provider
will display a scoped error while other providers continue to load.

## Smart Filtering

By default, if the directory you launch `dash` from is a clone of a remote GitHub repo (or if you
have the `GH_REPO` environment variable set to a particular remote), then for any of your PR
sections and issue sections with `filters` values in your [configuration](/configuration) that don’t
have an explicit `repo:` field, `dash` adds a `repo:<RepoName>` field to the search-bar value for
them (where _`<RepoName>`_ is the name of the remote repo).

That is, `dash` further filters those sections down to only the PRs/issues for the GitHub
repo name specified in your `GH_REPO` environment variable — or else the repo name of the remote
tracked by the clone directory from which `dash` launched.

For that, `dash` first checks and uses the repo name in the `GH_REPO` environment variable (if
you have that set). If `dash` doesn’t find that, then it next checks for the value of the remote
repo name tracked by the clone directory from which you launched `dash` — by looking through all
GitHub remotes configured for that clone in the following order:

1. `upstream`
2. `github`
3. `origin`

…and, otherwise, if `dash` finds no remotes with any of those names, then it uses the repo name
for the first remote in the output that `git remote` shows.

To disable Smart Filtering at launch, set `smartFilteringAtLaunch` to `false` in your [configuration](/configuration).

```yaml
smartFilteringAtLaunch: false
```

To toggle Smart Filtering on or off for the current section you’re currently viewing, either use the
`t` key — or else use whatever custom keybinding you have set for the `togglesearch` builtin in the
`keybindings` section of your [configuration](/configuration).
